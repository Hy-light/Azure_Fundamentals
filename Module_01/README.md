## 🏢 Before the Cloud

Before "the cloud," companies had to run and maintain their own infrastructure.

### 🖥️ What is a Datacenter?
- A large facility with physical servers, storage devices, networking hardware, and more.
- These house all the digital resources an organization needs.

### 🖧 On-Premises Servers
- Companies bought, installed, and maintained their own servers.
- Required electricity, cooling systems, physical space, and IT staff.

### ⚠️ Common Challenges
- High upfront cost
- Scaling took weeks or months
- Constant maintenance and upgrades
- Risk of hardware failure

## ☁️ What is the Cloud?

Cloud computing = Renting computing resources (servers, databases, apps) over the internet from providers like Microsoft Azure.

### 💡 Analogy: Netflix vs. DVDs
- DVDs: Buy or rent one at a time (like owning servers)
- Netflix: Stream content on-demand (like the cloud)

> **Key Idea:** The cloud is someone else’s computer — but smarter, faster, and globally available.
